<p>So I came across something interesting when looking at a friends site recently. This is a problem I think a lot of developers have run into at some point in their career. This issue is a sticky footer. My friend wanted a footer at the bottom of the page that if the content was too long it wouldn't sit on top of it, this elimates just having a positioned footer. You probably think of some other solutions but initial guesses don't lead to what you want and you decide to search the internet. Looking at twitter bootstraps sticky footer example I noticed they went about fixing it the same way my friend did. They use a basic structure like so</p>
<code><pre>&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;container&gt;
        &lt;content&gt;&lt;/content&gt;
        &lt;push&gt;&lt;/push&gt;
    &lt;/container&gt;
    &lt;footer&gt;
    &lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre></code>
<p>the way this trick works is to make the first container take up 100 percent of the height. Then create a negative margin on container to allow the footer to show. Right now we have a footer showing on the bottom but the content is able to eat over the footer because the negative margin causes the two to occupy the same space. To fix this a lot of people have decided to add a "push" div that sits and has no content but is given the height of the footer. This makes sure that the content doesn't touch the footer.</p> 
<p>My question is why are people doing this? They are affectively creating their own form of padding with a div? Why not just use padding? I tested just using padding and it works the same, as it should. Upon speaking with a couple friends one of them googled and came across a site that actually uses what I am saying <a href="http://www.cssstickyfooter.com/">http://www.cssstickyfooter.com/</a>, so I guess I was on the right track. It is interesting though that so many people used the solution for awhile. Blindlessly following a solution without actually thinking about what was happening. Kinda shows how a lot of us just take css for granted.</p>
